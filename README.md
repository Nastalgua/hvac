## HVAC
### What is this?
This is Matthew Chen's research during the Stony Brook CSIRE summer program. The goal of this research was to utilize Machine Learning in order to optimize HVAC systems to maximize on comfort and minimize costs. 

Information about the implementation can be found on this [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PnAS5JwDkBiq4A9lJHm5r-jkBWHALTr5/view) made at the end of the program.

### Future Goals
* Have AI take price into consideration.
* Improve AI for more complex environments.
* Add in other environment interferences (humidity, rain, sun).
